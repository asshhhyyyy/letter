Hi!

I just want to say na I admire you since we first met. I don't know why pero I found myself looking for you in a crowded room. I always stare at you kapag hindi ka nakatingin kasi I enjoy looking at your amazing features, from biggest to smallest. Sa ingay ng paligid. Ikaw ang aking katahimikan. I found myself smiling whenever nag-uusap tayo. Alam mo bang ikaw lang yung naging crush ko na hindi masungit. Ikaw yung taong laging seryoso kaya ako natutunaw e. Kaya siguro nagustuhan kita kasi you have that adorable and sweet personality. You have genuine and purest heart. Masaya na ako kapag nakikitang kang masaya.

Let me admire you from a far until my feelings for you fade away but now ipaparamdam ko sayo na you're loved and you're enough, more than enough, I have 4 months nalang para gawin iyon at sana maramdaman mo. Please take care of yourself, pahinga rin kapag kailangan. I'm always be hereee!
